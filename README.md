Too Long Didn't Do, break down your todo list into small 5 minute pieces

I am an avid procrastinator. I've always wanted to follow the motto, if you can do it within 5 minutes, do it now. Thats fun and all, but everything on my todo list takes upwards of two hours. 

Please bear with me. This is my first real C# program and I'm just testing the waters.
